## archino_2021
### purposes
+ This study is designed for automated detection and identification of three habitat-forming brown macroalgae within the Island Bay to Houghton Bay study region (Taputeranga Marine Reserve) in Wellington.

### observations
+ It uses underwater towed video imagery and surveys a total of 32 towed video transects, 12 in January 2019 and additional 20 in August 2020.
+ The surveyed area was designed to include a broad variety of reef sites with variable macroalgal cover and species composition, rather than
overlapping for temporal comparisons.
+ This study was conducted along an approximately 1.7 km section of exposed coastline encompassing Island Bay and Houghton Bay, on the Wellington south coast.
+ Taxonomies levels: two species (Ecklonia radiata and Lessonia variegata), one genus (Carpophyllum spp.: Carpophyllum flexuosum and Carpophyllum maschalocarpum), and a grouping of all macroalgae present.

### results
+ This study successfully shows that ML is significantly faster than traditional video analysis and is a cost-effective approach to post-process video imagery, and that will improve as more data are collected.
+ The ML models performed well at detecting and distinguishing between closely related species (Lessonia and Ecklonia), highlighting the accurate fine-tuned performance of thesemodels.
+ NIWA's 'seaweedai' Python package for programming ML models is advanced and will require ongoing maintenance and updating.


## b_2023
### purpose
+ A image-based identification system of  bird species identification is

### results
+ Proposed system using Random Forest algorithm with more features achieves accuracy of 80%, higher than existing system with Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree algorithms which has only 69% of accuracy.


## bartlett_2022
### purposes
+ An artificial intelligence (AI) machine-learning species indentifier, that takes as input locality data and a small number of the morphological parameters, has been developed.

### method
+ Informasion encoding in the form characters, where each features have different length and various possible values (continuous or discrete).
+ Base software was Python with its packages (PyTorch, SciPy, pandas, NumPy, dill, reverse_geocoder, etc).
+ Five optimizer were used, which are SGD, Adam, AdamW, Adam+AMSGrad, AdamW+AMSGrad.

### results
+ A novel way to attempt identifying collections to species or section is presented, which indicates that the approach of using character-based information as input to a machine learning algorithm shows significant promise.
+ The developed system was able to identify 77% correctly with its highest probabilistic match, 96% within its three likely determinations and over 99% of collections within its five most likely determinations.


## gupta_2021
### purposes
+ The scientific classification of a species demands prior knowledge for identification, which is suitable for machine learning based system.
+ Automatic identification using machine learning model can be used to reduce time, cost, and labor.

### methods
+ Google teachable machine (GTM) is a fairly new graphical user interface (GUI) based tool introduced in 2019, that is based on TensorFlow, which is Javascript library of ML algorithms.
+ It does not require coding or scripting skills to build ML models (Carney et al. 2020).

### results
+ It shows that the ML model can be developed with ease using GTM and incorporated in mobile and website or can be directly excess with the shareable link.
+ The key strengths of this study are its user-friendly online ML platform and accessibility after training the cricket classification model.
+ ML model can be trained on the GTM platform for image-based classification in biological sciences, including insect classification (current study only uses two cricket species).
