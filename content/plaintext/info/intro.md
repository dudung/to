## recreate notes
It is simply another notes for my journey in expressing my thought with limitation of time and energy. Previous form of the notes is the [lecture-notes](https://dudung.github.io/lecture-notes/), which is started also this year in with the first commit was on [Jun 23](https://github.com/dudung/lecture-notes/tree/1a27ce48) and the lecture-notes was used as primary site for all lectures given in first semester of academic year 2023-2024 or we call it 2023-1. I try to force all activities to this notes, but it did not work well since they have different characteristics.


## problems 
+ Rules the use of GitHub, OSF, Zenodo, Edunex, Medium, and plaintext. And how they interact to each other.
+ How detail the information you should write.
+ Connection between notes.
+ Notes url, is it four digits adequate? Should it be in numbers only or combinations of numbers and letters?


## convention
+ plaintext will list only post with my original texts.
+ It will use plain text or SVG images, where other types of media will be only provided as link even Hugo can rendered them.
+ Graphics are in Chart.js.
+ Diagrams are in Mermaid.
+ Equations are in LaTeX.
+ Others are using JavaScript libraries, in order to represent in plain text.
+ One day one note, at least, more is allowed.
+ Language: en, id, de.
