## intro
The Newton-Raphson method is a method for finding succesively and quickly better approximation for the roots of a real-valued functions (Çapar, 2020). It is one of the most widely used methods for root finding and it can be shown that this technique is quadratically convergent as the root aproached (Smith, 1998). This algorithm is quite versatile with wide-ranging use cases than span many domains, e.g by reframing the function of interest for the value of $x$ that yields a certain value rather than being restricted to $0$ can be searched (Dolphin, 2022). There is a report about historical development of this method (Ypma, 1995), where there are differences between this technique and Newton's technique (Nadhim & Al-Jilawi, 2022).


## formula
+ The Newton-Raphson method has a iterative formula in finding root of $f(x)$ as follow
$$\tag{1}
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$
with $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$, $x_0$ is the initial guess for the root, and $f'(x)$ is derivative of $f(x)$. 
+ As $n$ increases, the value of $f(x_n)$ is nearer to $0$.


## flowchart
+ The Newton-Raphson method can be represented in following flowchart.

+ Parameter $\varepsilon$ is small value that is acceptable representing $0$, since it might require a lot of iterations to find $f(x) = 0$, where $f(x) \approx 0$ is easier.


## algorithm
1. Start.
2. Input $f(x)$, $f'(x)$, $\varepsilon$, $x_0$.
3. Set $n = 0$.
4. Calculate $x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)$.
5. If $f(x_{n+1}) < \varepsilon$, go to Step 8.
6. Increase $n$ using $n = n + 1$.
7. Go to Step 4.
8. Print $x_{n+1}$.
9. End.


## problem
+ Equation to be solved is
$$\tag{2}
f(x) = x^2 - 102.345x + 234.5.
$$
+ Its derivative
$$\tag{3}
f'(x) = 2x - 102.345x.
$$


## code
+ An example of code in JS is as follow.
  ```js
  function f0(x) {
    let y = x**2 - 102.345*x + 234.5;
    return y;
  }

  function f1(x) {
    let y = 2*x - 102.345;
    return y;
  }

  let eps = 1E-5;
  let n = 0
  let x = [];
  x[n] = 10;
  let fx = f0(x[n]);

  console.log("n   x[n]           f(x[n])     eps");
  while(Math.abs(fx) > eps) {
    console.log(
      n, ' ',
      x[n].toExponential(7), ' ',
      fx.toExponential(4), ' ',
      eps
    );

    xx = x[n] - f0(x[n]) / f1(x[n]); 
    x.push(xx);
    
    fx = f0(x[n+1]);
    
    n = n + 1;
  }
  console.log(
    n, ' ',
    x[n].toExponential(7), ' ',
    fx.toExponential(4), ' ',
    eps
  );

  console.log();
  console.log("root = ", x[n].toFixed(5));
  ```

## challenges
+ Explain in brief the background of Newton-Raphson method and how it is formulated until the iterative formula in Equation (1) is obtained. If necessary draw also some graphs to make the exlplanation clearer.
+ Try to find the root of
$$\tag{4}
f(x) = x - 3.45,
$$
and show which part of the given code should be modified.
+ Compare the result obtained previously using bisection method in [0004](../0004). Which one is more efficient?
+ Compare the flowchart for scanning method in [000s](../000s), bisection method in [0004](../0004) and Newton-Raphson method here. Which one is easier to understand? Why?
+ Find roots of
$$\tag{5}
f(x) = (x - 1.23456)(x - 9.87654)(x - 23.45678),
$$
with different initial guesses, e.g. 0, 5, 11, 40. Create table to show the relation between initial guess and root found.
+ What will happen if $x_0 = 5 \pm \delta$ in finding root of
$$\tag{6}
f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 8)
$$
by varying value of $\delta$ to assure that both roots are found.
+ Until now all examples are in the form of polynomial, will this method also work for non-polynomial function? Test it for at least such functions. Report the results.
