Info about 3rd generation in sharing slides <!--more-->


## intro
For slides there are changes in where the place I share them. The first was SlideShare and must be left because of login problem due to the event when Scribd acquired SlideShare [^ha_2020]. Next is Zenodo, which is awesome since it has DOI even for versioning [^nielsen_2017]. I am not quite remember about ResearchGate, that there might be some slides also deposited there. Just mark it as 2.5 generation :grin:. And the current plase is OSF since it has the best way in showing PDF slide in full screen, better than the previous place.
