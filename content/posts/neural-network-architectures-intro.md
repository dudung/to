Short intro and overview about neural network architectures <!--more-->


## intro
A report about overview of neural network (NN) architectures is very interesting, since it has a unique title, The Neural Network Zoo [leijnen_2020], which includes the well-known figure listing near complete of neural network architectures [vanveen_2016].

This post is kindly similar but, hopefully, more easier to read, since I am still learning about NN.
