## intro
It is a journal name, Edsence,  a national journal intended as a communication forum for Multimedia and other scientists from many practitioners who use Multimedia in research [^edsence_2024]. It uses version 2.4.8.5 of Open Journal System (OJS), a journal management system and online publishing developed by Public Knowledge Project supported  by federal goverment in order to to widen and enhace access to research results [^indriani_2010]. And about the multimedia itself, it is a means to convey information in the form of a combination of various media [^faizal_2021].

It is recognized that a journalâ€™s content is a fundamental way in which researchers engage with journals [^rg_2023], but reading all articles of Edsence is overwhelming. It becomes feasible if only discussing the keywords, by assuming that the content is represented by its kewords, choosing good keywords which are relevant and specific to your research can increase the number of people finding and reading your manuscript and, therefore, could lead to more citations [^jmireditor_2024].
