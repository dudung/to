Illustration of summation, multiplication, exponentiation and then to hyperoperation sequence <!--more-->


## intro
Once upon a time it was a puzzle for me about how summation of same numbers can turn into multiplication, and multiplication of same numbers can turn into exponentiation. Then what is next? What would be the name of exponentiation of some numbers? And what is the terms representing those operations? Communication with ChatGPT 3.5 give answer about the last, which is known as hyperoperation sequence [^openai_2024]. And the format how to cite the activity is also already available [^caufield_2023], as used here but with a little modification. A quick search using Google found some results, one of them is for me fun to read [^sharma_2024].
