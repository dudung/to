A short story without any purposes
<!--more-->

The same problem comes again and I follow the desire to make a new static site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The last site is [o](https://dudung.github.io/o/), which still has the same style as this one. Usually, I become confused when there is already a lot of posts in a site, especially when it has various types of post that each have differents characteristics. Fortunately, a lot of posts are good for viewing how style works with many posts, that might look differently when only with few posts.
