Short intro to SVG and some simple examples <!--more-->


## intro
SVG, that stands for scalable vector graphis, is a web friendly vector-based file format used to render two-dimensional images on the internet, and it is written in pure XML [^chris_2022], which makes it can be created or edited using any text and code editor. Other than to code SVG, there is also a lot of drawing applications available that can be used to open and edit SVG files [^fisher_2022].
