A short story without any purposes <!--more-->

The same problem comes again and I follow the desire to make a new static site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The last site is [o](https://dudung.github.io/o/), which still has the same style as this one. Usually, I become confused when there is already a lot of posts in a site, especially when it has various types of post that each have differents characteristics. Fortunately, a lot of posts are good for viewing how style works with many posts, that might look differently when only with few posts.

I just find out about how to make footnote[^1], which is very convenient for writing references. Thanks to Foster and Valero for the wiki page. What is still not so good looking is that the horizontal line preceeding the footnotes. Perhaps it can be controlled with CSS. It will be later handled. First I must finish this story, which does not has any purposes while writing it.

Equations. What does it have to do with equations? Well I like it and the first love in writing a post using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) then [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is their support on [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for providing [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) equations.

This is an inline math mode, e.g. $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, while

$$\tag{1}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

is display math mode. In the first mode, equation is part of a paragraph, while in the second mode it has its own paragraph. Unfortunately, as fas as I know as about several months ago, link to an equation has not yet work.

LaTeX code for previous equations are

```tex
$y = ax^2 + bx + c$

$$\tag{1}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
```

Eqn (1) can be calculated using any programming languages, e.g. Python, as follow

```python
# finding roots using quadratic formula
a = 1
b = -5
c = 6
x1 = -b + (b*b - 4*a*c)**0.5
x2 = -b - (b*b - 4*a*c)**0.5
print('x1 =', x1)
print('x2 =', x2)
```

From previous example you can see that the code uses the same symbols as in Eqn (2) in providing clear connection between the equation and the code, which can be considered as self-explanation feature, that will help the reader a lot.

Actually, above can can be first design using flowchart before code it. On of the possible flowchart is as follow.

{{< mermaid >}}
flowchart LR
  B --> I --> P --> O --> E
  B(["Begin"])
  I[/"a, b, c"/]
  P["x<sub>1</sub> = -b + (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>&half;</sup>
  x<sub>2</sub> = -b - (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>&half;</sup>"]
  O[/"x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>"/]
  E(["End"])
{{< /mermaid >}}

The flowchart is created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), where

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  B --> I --> P --> O --> E
  B(["Begin"])
  I[/"a, b, c"/]
  P["x<sub>1</sub> = -b + (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>&half;</sup>
  x<sub>2</sub> = -b - (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>&half;</sup>"]
  O[/"x1, x2"/]
  E(["End"])
```

is the code.

## chart, music, molecules
Well, it is unusual to correlate chart, music, and molecules, right? But there are only feature that can be supported using this Hugo-based static site.

Let us show the chart, e.g. xy scatter? Well, it can be fascillitated using Chart.js and Hugo shortcode as follow.

as the result. With this feature you can have a chart and also the data at the same time. Availability access to the data for the chart can be considered as advantage or disadvantage. That depends on what we considere.

Now, it is time for musical notes.

{{< blank/abcjs >}}

The notes can be displayed using [abcjs](https://www.abcjs.net/), a JS library, combined with Hugo shortcode.

I choose the song because it is simple and the only song that I remember the notes. Well, I am not good in musics, but I like to play it. But, of course, just for my self, since it will, Unfortunately, noise to the others ☹️.

Well, last but not the least is the molecules. We can display molecules in a post as follow.

are some style changes for footnotes.


## markdown
I think I might later write about examples of using Markdown in this part. Well, it might be happend or it might be not.

No | First Name | Last Name
:-: | :- | :-
1 | Mister | Nobody
2 | Jane | Doe
3 | Fulana | Fulan
4 | Nate | Avail

Above table is obtained using

```md
No | First Name | Last Name
:-: | :- | :-
1 | Mister | Nobody
2 | Jane | Doe
3 | Fulana | Fulan
4 | Nate | Avail
```

as the Markdown code. Following icon in PNG format

![GitHub Octocat](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/free-github-34-225988.png?f=webp&w=100)

can be viewed using following code

```md
![GitHub Octocat](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/free-github-34-225988.png?f=webp&w=100)
```

Then how about list?

      - Grape
      - Roma
      - Green
    + Wheat
    + Paddy

  - Tree

Above list is obtained using following lines of Markdown code

```md

What is the following?

It is a quote and the above appearance is obtained using following code

Hello! :wave:

## closing
+ `05-may-2024` It is 2310 now and I am tired. This post will be continued tomorrow early morning, while performing sahur, hopefully. I have to go to bed now.
+ `06-may-2024` A new post [0002](../0002) is being created. Perhaps the Markdown part of this post will also be the same. Today the other post will be the focus and not this one.
