Short intro to SVG and some simple examples <!--more-->


## intro
As an open standard developed by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/about/), [SVG image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) has several advantages over raster image (e.g. [JPG](https://jpeg.org/), [GIF](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif87.txt), [PNG](http://www.libpng.org/)), which are scalability, interactivity, easily editable, compact file size, and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1217219943) friendly [^tierney_2017], where Its interactivity feature can be performed using only CSS [^mustapha_2023] or further advanced with JS [^mcknight_2021]. There are already available softwares to animate SVG image using CSS only and also with JS [^kaushik_2023]. But since it is XML-based you can make it from scratch using any plain text editor. Common use cases for animating SVG with CSS are for icons, data visualizations, interactive states, stickers and emojis [^armstrong_2024]. SVG is also a solution for consistency in displaying images on various and diverse device screen settings, since it can create a visual interesting look for websites without additional load time burder [^calou_2022].

In this post only [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) will be used in creating SVG animation but not yet with [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). How to advance it with JS will be in another post.
