## 8-1 Potential Energy (1 of 13)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.01 Distinguish a conservative force force from a nonconservative force.
+ 8.02 For a particle moving between two points, identify that the work done by a conservative force does not depend on which path the particle takes.
+ 8.03 Calculate the gravitational potential energy of a particle (or, more properly, a particle-Earth system).
+ 8.04 Calculate the elastic potential energy of a block-spring system.


## 8-2 Conservation of Mechanical Energy (1 of 5)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.05 After first clearly defining which objects form a system, identify that the mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies of those objects.
+ 8.06 For an isolated system in which only conservative forces act, apply the conservation of mechanical energy to relate the initial potential and kinetic energies to the potential and kinetic energies at a later instant.


## LO 8-3 Reading a Potential Energy Curve (1 of 8)
+ 8.07 Given a particle's potential energy as a function of position x, determine the force on the particle.
+ 8.08 Given a graph of potential energy versus x, determine the force on a particle.
+ 8.09 On a graph of potential energy versus x, superimpose a line for a particle's mechanical energy and determine kinetic energy for any given value of x.


## 8-3 Reading a Potential Energy Curve (2 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.10 If a particle moves along an x axis, use a potential-energy graph for that axis and the conservation of mechanical energy to relate the energy values at one position to those at another position.
+ 8.11 On a potential-energy graph, identify any turning points and any regions where the particle is not allowed because of energy requirements.
+ 8.12 Explain neutral equilibrium, stable equilibrium, and unstable equilibrium.


## 8-4 Work Done on a System by an External Force (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.13 When work is done on a system by an external force with no friction involved, determine the changes in kinetic energy and potential energy.
+ 8.14 When work is done on a system by an external force with friction involved, relate that work to the changes in kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy


## 8-5 Conservation of Energy (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.15 For an isolated system (no net external force), apply the conservation of energy to relate the initial total energy (energies of all kinds) to the total energy at a later instant.
+ 8.16 For a nonisolated system, relate the work done on the system by a net external force to the changes in the various types of energies within the system.


## 8-5 Conservation of Energy (2 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 8.17 Apply the relationship between average power, the associated energy transfer, and the time interval in which that transfer is made.
+ 8.18 Given an energy transfer as a function of time (either as an equation or graph), determine the instantaneous power (the transfer at any given instant).
