## 5-3 Applying Newton's Laws (1 of 20)
Learning Objectives
+ 5.14 Identify Newton's third law of motion and third-law of force pairs.
5.15 For an object that moves vertically or on a horizontal or inclined plane, apply Newton's second law to a free-body diagram of the object.
+ 5.16 For an arrangement where a system of several objects moves rigidly together, draw a free-body diagram and apply Newton's second law for the individual objects and also for the system taken as a composite object.


## 5 Summary (1 of 5)
+ Newtonian Mechanics
  - Forces are pushes or pulls
  - Forces cause acceleration
+ Force
  - Vector quantities
  - 1 N = 1 kg m/s2
  - Net force is the sum of all forces on a body


## 5 Summary (2 of 5)
+ Newton's First Law
  - If there is no net force on a body, the body remains at rest if it is initially at rest, or moves in a straight line at constant speed if it is in motion.
+ Inertial Reference Frames
 - Frames in which Newtonian mechanics holds

 
## 5 Summary (3 of 5)
+ Mass
  - The characteristic that relates the body's acceleration to the net force
  - Scalar quantit
+ Newton's Second Law
  $$\tag{5-1}
  \vec{F}_{\rm net} = m \vec{a}
  $$
  - Free-body diagram represents the forces on one object


## 5 Summary (4 of 5)
+ Some Particular Forces
  - Weight:
  $$\tag{5-12}
  W =  mg
  $$
  - Normal force from a surface
  - Friction along a surface
  - Tension in a cord


## 5 Summary (5 of 5)
+ Newton's Third Law
  - Law of force-pairs
  - If there is a force by B on C, then there is a force by C on B:
  $$\tag{5-15}
  \vec{F}_{BC} = -\vec{F}_{CB}
  $$
