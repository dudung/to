## 7-1 Kinetic Energy (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.01 Apply the relationship between a particle's kinetic energy, ass, and speed.
+ 7.02 Identify that kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.


## 7-2 Work and Kinetic Energy (1 of 16)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.03 Apply the relationship between a force (magnitude and direction) and the work done on a particle by the force when the particle undergoes a displacement.
+ 7.04 Calculate work by taking a dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector, in either magnitude-angle or unit-vector notation.
+ 7.05 If multiple forces act on a particle, calculate the net work done by them.
+ 7.06 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to relate the work done by a force (or the net work done by multiple forces) and the resulting change in kinetic energy.


## 7-3 Work Done by the Gravitational Force (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.07 Calculate the work done by the gravitational force when an object is lifted or lowered.
+ 7.08 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to situations where an object is lifted or lowered.


## 7-4 Work Done by a Spring Force (1 of 13)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.09 Apply the relationship (Hooke's law) between spring force, the stretch or compression of the spring, and the spring constant.
+ 7.10 Identify that a spring force is a variable force.
+ 7.11 Calculate the work done on an object by a spring force by integrating the force from the initial position to the final position of the object or by using the known generic result of the integration.


## 7-4 Work Done by a Spring Force (2 of 13)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.12 Calculate work by graphically integrating on a graph of force versus position of the object.
+ 7.13 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to situations in which an object is moved by a spring force.


## 7-5 Work Done by a General Variable Force (1 of 5)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.14 Given a variable force as a function of position, calculate the work done by it on an object by integrating the function from the initial to the final position of the object in one or more dimensions.
+ 7.15 Given a graph of force versus position, calculate the work done by graphically integrating from the initial position to the final position of the object.


## 7-5 Work Done by a General Variable Force (2 of 5)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.16 Convert a graph of acceleration versus position to a graph of force versus position.
+ 7.17 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to situations where an object is moved by a variable force.


## 7-6 Power (1 of 5)
Learning Objectives
+ 7.18 Apply the relationship between average power, the work done by a force, and the time interval in which that work is done.
+ 7.19 Given the work as a function of time, find the instantaneous power.
+ 7.20 Determine the instantaneous power by taking a dot product of the force vector and an object's velocity vector, in magnitudeangle and unit-vector notations.
