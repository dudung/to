## introduction
+ A random number is a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all numbers occurring in the specified distribution, which are most commonly produced with the help of a random number generator ([Rouse, 2016](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31706/random-number)).
+ It is a number which is generated for, or part of, a set exhibiting statistical randomness, where the statistical randomness is a characteristic where a numeric sequence is said to be statistically random when it contains no recognisable patterns or regularities ([WHS, 2021](http://whs-blogs.co.uk/teaching/what-is-a-random-number-and-what-is-the-random-number-generator/)).
+ A random number is a number chosen as if by chance from some specified distribution such that selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces the underlying distribution and almost always, such numbers are also required to be independent, so that there are no correlations between successive numbers
([Weisstein, 2023](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomNumber.html)).


## random function
There is a function to generate random float number ([MND, 2023](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random?retiredLocale=de))
> The `Math.random()` static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.
