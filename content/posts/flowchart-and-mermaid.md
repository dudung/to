Short intro about fowchart and the use of Mermaid <!--more-->

## intro
The activity of using flowchart, or flowcharting, is a means of graphically stating ways of solving information handling problems, as people use the terms in working with computers[^chapin_1970]. It is a graphical representation of a process, where each process step is represented by a different symbol that contains a brief description of the process step [^karan_2023]. In process industry, flowcharts are used to indicate flow of the product during various stages or the process, where it is a combination of an outline process chart and the flow diagram, where each operation is represented by the appropriate shape of the equipment [^kiran_2019].

Flowchars are used in a wide variety of disciplines and fields, from software development to education to business and beyond, that might be used for document a process, identify potential breakdowns and bottlenecks in a process, visualize dependencies in a process, automate a manual process, visualize the flow of data, plan a project, identify the right person to own a task or project, troubleshoot technical issues, and make a decision that involves multiple variables [^ward_2021].

Remember the purpose when begin to use flow chart, since readability is probably the most important aspect of a flowchart,  where as the diagrammatic representation of a process, the flowchart aims to offer a visual description of a process to help us understand what is going on, but flowcharts can get a bit out of control and you can end up with something so complicated that it defeats the purpose of having one [^rila_2021].

Then how to create a flowchart? There are at least about 15 best software that can help you in creating flowcharts online and offline [^york_2024]. Not included on the list, there is also Mermaid. Mermaid is a powerful JavaScript library that can build a variety of charts and diagrams from a specialized flavor of Markdown, where one of them is flowchart [^elland_2023]. With Mermaid you have to code for creating flocharts. Rather than using traditional method to manually create flowcharts, there are several advantages in generating flowcharts as code, e.g. dynamic, editable, efficient, and quick to create [^hira_2023]. 


## types
Type of process flowcharts represent and their purpose determine their types as follow [^developer_2023], where the first four are the main types, while the last six are additional sepecific purposes types.

+ **Document Flowcharts**. These type is designed to show the existing controls over the document flow through the components of the system, e.g. various business units, and it is read from left to right.
+ **Data Flowcharts**. This type represents the controls governing data flows within the system and is used primarily to show the channels through which data is transmitted throughout the system, which focuses on channels of data transmission, rather than how control flow is represented as in previous type.
+ **System Flowcharts**. The flow of data to and through the main components of the system such as programs, storage media, data entry, processors, and communication networks are represented using this type of flowchart.

- Program Flowcharts \
These flowcharts represent the controls placed internally in a program within a system.
- Swimlane Flowchart \
these flowcharts segment different functionalities into separate lanes. For example, a swimlane diagram may be created with routes for the work processes performed by other organizational areas like human resources, operations, and accounting.
- Workflow Flowchart \
these flowcharts are used to document workflows that involve tasks, documents, and information in offices.
- Cross-Functional Flowcharts \
This type of flowchart is usually used to delineate who does what in a cross-functional team. They represent who is responsible for ensuring that different functions are executed and when they are executed. Such flowcharts are extremely useful when dealing with an extensive, complex process involving multiple teams, people, and departments, to understand the information flow between different areas.
- Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) Flowchart \
These flowcharts are used to document or plan a business process.
- Specification And Description Language (SDL) Flowchart \
These flowcharts are used to brainstorm computer algorithms based on 3 basic components – system definition, block, and process. An SDL diagram illustrates the modeling language used to show how event-driven applications work in real-time. They are predominantly used in aviation, automotive, communication, and medical industries. The behavior of complex software can be effectively described with SDL flowcharts.
- Influence Diagram \
Influence diagrams are visual representations of decision problems. The main purpose of these flowcharts is to outline critical elements like roadblocks or objectives to achieve at different points.
