Formulas in assessment document for accreditation <!--more-->


## intro
Accreditation is the formal and independent verification that a program or institution meets established quality standards and is competent to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks as quoted from IAS [^umnadmin_2023]. An institutional accreditation is comprehensive, covering financial status, governance, student services, faculty and staff relations and achievements as well as student learning and achievement [^chea_1998]. In general accreditation lowers risk, reduces costs and improves reputation, and in addition, it also ncreases the level of trust that is needed for business investments [^niksirat_2020]. It can be applied also to an education institution, since not only as consumption, education is also an investment [^mahes_2023].
