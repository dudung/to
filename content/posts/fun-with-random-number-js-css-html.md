Using random number for CSS and HTML using JS <!--more-->


## intro
To generate random number in JS `math.random()` method can be used, which produces a pseudo-random floating point-number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) [^yajasvikhqmsg_2024], which can later be processed to create certain random numbers, e.g. decimal with specified max or min-max range, integer with specified max or min-max range, and ones with specified inclusive [^lemonaki_2022]. Beside the pseudo-random generator provided in `Math` object, there are also some alternatives, e.g. one supported by some browsers or create yourself some functions [^castrogiovanni_2021].

In this post results of using random number in JS is shown in HTML with support of CSS. HMTL is a markup language, CSS is a styling language, and JS is a programming language, where they are working together to render the interactive results displayed in a web browser [^patel_2020]. It is also assumed that you are already familiar with JS, CSS, and HTML.
