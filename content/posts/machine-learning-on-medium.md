Finding stories about machine learning on Medium <!--more-->


## intro
I am beginner in machine learning and want to learn it by examples instead of by theories. I believe after knowing what comes out, the theories will be clearer as I read them later, hopefully. This might the efficent way in learning a new thing that is so popular. Could it be a hypothesis?


## google
As the first step I use Google to searh following terms

```
+"machine learning" beginner example +python -"member-only story" site:medium.com
```

and I get [^google_2024]

```
Ungefähr 1.130 Ergebnisse (0,17 Sekunden)
```

where I only list some of them, the top of the list ones.


## results
The top 20 top results using previous terms are as follow

It is actually a Member-only story, but there are notification

> You're reading for free via Towards AI Editorial Team's Friend Link. Become a member to access the best of Medium.

but after reopen it, the "Friend link" does not work anymore. So, I can read with when I open it again in Microsoft Edge as the first time, while previously it is opened and reopened in Google Chrome. An as I repopen that in a new tab on Edge, it becomes Member-only story which I can not read anymore, while the first tab still works until I refresh it. I believe hat it is a mechanisme to avoid in sharing the link to third person or further person?

Since Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is mainly used in tasks related to machine learning, analysis, and web development, this story tells about 15+ Python GUI projects, but not all related to machine learning. The projects are as follow

to master any of these skills with Python, you must first become an expert in Python. These 15+ Python projects with source code will allow you to become an expert in Python:

I think that number 15 might use AI or machine learning in the term of NLP for the chat but unfortunately

The website "https://thecleverprogrammer.com/machine-learning/" is up and the author "Aman Kharwal" is there. Perhaps only 15 not there anymore?
