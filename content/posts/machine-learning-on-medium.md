Finding stories about machine learning on Medium <!--more-->


## intro
I am beginner in machine learning and want to learn it by examples instead of by theories. I believe after knowing what comes out, the theories will be clearer as I read them later, hopefully. This might the efficent way in learning a new thing that is so popular, as I hypothesize it here.


## google
As the first step I use Google to searh following terms

```
+"machine learning" beginner example +python -"member-only story" site:medium.com
```

and I get [^google_2024]

```
Ungefähr 1.130 Ergebnisse (0,17 Sekunden)
```

where I only list some of them, the top of the list ones.
