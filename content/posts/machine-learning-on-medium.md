Finding stories about machine learning on Medium <!--more-->


## intro
I am beginner in machine learning and want to learn it by examples instead of by theories. I believe after knowing what comes out, the theories will be clearer as I read them later, hopefully. This might the efficent way in learning a new thing that is so popular. Could it be a hypothesis?


## google
As the first step I use Google to searh following terms

```
+"machine learning" beginner example +python -"member-only story" site:medium.com
```

and I get [^google_2024]

```
Ungefähr 1.130 Ergebnisse (0,17 Sekunden)
```

where I only list some of them, the top of the list ones.


## results
The top 20 top results using previous terms are as follow

It is actually a Member-only story, but there are notification

> You're reading for free via Towards AI Editorial Team's Friend Link. Become a member to access the best of Medium.

but after reopen it, the "Friend link" does not work anymore. So, I can read with when I open it again in Microsoft Edge as the first time, while previously it is opened and reopened in Google Chrome. An as I repopen that in a new tab on Edge, it becomes Member-only story which I can not read anymore, while the first tab still works until I refresh it. I believe hat it is a mechanisme to avoid in sharing the link to third person or further person?
