Relative position of an object is position of the object measured relatively from other object, which simply substraction of the object position and other object position ([Smith, 2012](https://astarmathsandphysics.com/igcse-maths-notes/510-relative-velocities-and-relative-positions.html#)). Numerical calculation in solving physics problem is recommended, because the difficulty faced by the students will be a valuable experience in advancing their understanding and skill ([Allain, 2017](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/physics-teachers-really-teach-numerical-calculations/)). Here illustration about relative position is given and it is also accompanied with a numerical example.

Figure 1. A passanger P is on boat B, which is moving along a canal C.

Suppose that there is a moving boat B along a canal C, where on the boat there is a passanger P walk on the boat.


## notation
As the illustration example in Figure 1 will be used, where there are passanger on a moving boat along a canal. Point O, a point on an edge of the canal, can be considered as fixed point in rest reference of frame. Position of the boat B can be defined relatively to this point as

$$
\vec{r} _{\rm BO} = \vec{r} _{\rm B} - \vec{r} _{\rm O},
$$

where rB and rO are vector in global frame of reference. Similar to previous equation relative position of passanger P to the boat B is simply

$$
\vec{r} _{\rm PB} = \vec{r} _{\rm P} - \vec{r} _{\rm B}.
$$

Then, position of passanger P relatively to the canal will be

$$
\vec{r} _{\rm PO} = \vec{r} _{\rm P} - \vec{r} _{\rm O},
$$

Notice that relative position with indices A folowed by B means vector position of A minus vector position of B, and position vector with only one letter index can be considered that second index is simply (0, 0, 0).


## numerical calculation
In order to get quantitative sense of previous example, Figure 1 is detailed as follow.

To provide quantitative value Figure 2 is drawn with grid size of 2 m Ã— 2 m. Then following relative position can be obtained

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vec{r} _{\rm S} & = & (9 \cdot 2) \hat{x} + (6 \cdot 2) \hat{y} = 18\hat{x} + 12\hat{y}, \newline
\vec{r} _{\rm TS} & = & (5 \cdot 2) \hat{x} + (1 \cdot 2) \hat{y} = 10\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}, \newline
\vec{r} _{\rm PT} & = & (-3 \cdot 2) \hat{x} + (1 \cdot 2) \hat{y} = -6\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}.
\end{array}
$$

Besides above equation, there is also a relation

$$
\vec{r} _{\rm P} = \vec{r} _{\rm PT} + \vec{r} _{\rm TS} + \vec{r} _{\rm S},
$$

that, when it is substituted with previous equations, will produce

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vec{r} _{\rm P} & = & \vec{r} _{\rm PT} + \vec{r} _{\rm TS} + \vec{r} _{\rm S} \newline
& = & d (-6\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}) + (10\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}) + (18\hat{x} + 12\hat{y}) \newline
& = & (-6 + 10 + 18)\hat{x} + (2 + 2 + 12)\hat{y} \newline
& = & 22\hat{x} + 16\hat{y},
\end{array}
$$

that the result can be confirmed by calculating number of grids for $\vec{r}_{\rm P}$ from Figure 2.


## challenges
1. What would be the result of $\vec{r} _{\rm PB} + \vec{r} _{\rm BO}$? Can you deduce something about index relation between relative position vectors?
2. Using Figure 2 find $\vec{r} _{\rm T}$ directly by counting number of grids involved and by using $\vec{r} _{\rm S}$ and $\vec{r} _{\rm TS}$. Compare the two results and discuss it.
3. A ship S is moving in x+ direction with velocity $v_{x}$ = 4 m/s. Write position of ship S as function of time t when its position at t = 0 s is as given in Figure 2.
