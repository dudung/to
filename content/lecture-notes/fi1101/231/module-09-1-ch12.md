## 12-1 Equilibrium (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 12.01 Distinguish between equilibrium and static equilibrium.
+ 12.02 Specify the four conditions for static equilibrium.
+ 12.03 Explain center of gravity and how it relates to center of mass.
+ 12.04 For a given distribution of particles, calculate the coordinates of the center of gravity and the center of mass.


## 12-2 Some Examples of Static Equilibrium (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 12.05 Apply the force and torque conditions for static equilibrium.
+ 12.06 Identify that a wise choice about the placement of the origin (about which to calculate torques) can simplify the calculations by eliminating one or more unknown forces from the torque equation.


## 12-3 Elasticity (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 12.07 Explain what an indeterminate situation is.
+ 12.08 For tension and compression, apply the equation that relates stress to strain and Young's modulus.
+ 12.09 Distinguish between yield strength and ultimate strength.
+ 12.10 For shearing, apply the equation that relates stress to strain and the shear modulus.
+ 12.11 For hydraulic stress, apply the equation that relates fluid pressure to strain and the bulk modulus.


## Summary (1 of 3)
+ Static Equilibrium.
+ Elastic Moduli.
+ Tension and Compression.
+ Shearing.
+ Hydraulic Stress.
