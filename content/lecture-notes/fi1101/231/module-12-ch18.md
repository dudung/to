## 18-1 Temperature (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 18.01 Identify the lowest temperature as 0 on the Kelvin scale (absolute zero).
+ 18.02 Explain the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
+ 18.03 Explain the conditions for the triple-point temperature.
+ 18.04 Explain the conditions for measuring a temperature with a constant-volume gas thermometer.
+ 18.05 For a constant-volume gas thermometer, relate the pressure and temperature of the gas in some given state to the pressure and temperature at the triple point.


## 18-3 Thermal Expansion (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 18.08 For one-dimensional thermal expansion, apply the relationship between the temperature change $\Delta T$, the length change $\Delta L$, the initial length $L$, and the coefficient of linear expansion $\alpha$.
+ 18.09 For two-dimensional thermal expansion, use one dimensional thermal expansion to find the change in area.


## 18-3 Thermal Expansion (2 of 12)
+ 18.10 For three-dimensional thermal expansion, apply the relationship between the temperature change $\Delta T$,
the volume change $\Delta V$, the initial volume $V$, and the
coefficient of volume expansion $\beta$.


## 18-4 Absorption of Heat (1 of 14)
Learning Objectives
+ 18.11 Identify that thermal energy is associated with the random motions of the microscopic bodies in an object.
+ 18.12 Identify that heat Q is the amount of transferred energy (either to or from an object’s thermal energy) due to a temperature difference between the object and its environment.
+ 18.13 Convert energy units between various measurement systems.
+ 18.14 Convert between mechanical or electrical energy and thermal energy


## 18-4 Absorption of Heat (2 of 14)
+ 18.15 For a temperature change $\Delta T$ of a substance, relate the change to the heat transfer $Q$ and the substance’s heat capacity $C$.
+ 18.16 For a temperature change $\Delta T$ of a substance, relate the change to the heat transfer $Q$ and the substance’s specific heat $c$ and mass $m$.


## 18-4 Absorption of Heat (3 of 14)
+ 18.17 Identify the three phases of matter.
+ 18.18 For a phase change of a substance, relate the heat transfer $Q$, the heat of transformation $L$, and the amount
of mass $m$ transformed.
+ 18.19 Identify that if a heat transfer $Q$ takes a substance across a phase-change temperature, the transfer must be calculated in steps: (a) a temperature change to reach the phase-change temperature, (b) the phase change, and then (c) any temperature change that moves the substance away from the phase-change temperature.


## 18-5 The First Law of Thermodynamics (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 18.20 If an enclosed gas expands or contracts, calculate the work $W$ done by the gas by integrating the gas pressure with respect to the volume of the enclosure.
+ 18.21 Identify the algebraic sign of work $W$ associated with expansion and contraction of a gas.
+ 18.22 Given a $p-V$ graph of pressure versus volume for a process, identify the starting point (the initial state) and the final point (the final state) and calculate the work by using graphical integration.
+ 18.23 On a $p-V$ graph of pressure versus volume for a gas, identify the algebraic sign of the work associated with a right-going process and a left-going process.


## 18-5 The First Law of Thermodynamics (2 of 8)
+ 18.24 Apply the first law of thermodynamics to relate the change in the internal energy $\Delta E_{\rm int}$ of a gas, the energy $Q$ transferred as heat to or from the gas, and the work $W$ done on or by the gas.
+ 18.25 Identify the algebraic sign of a heat transfer Q that is associated with a transfer to a gas and a transfer from the gas.
+ 18.26 Identify that the internal energy $\Delta E_{\rm int}$ of a gas tends to increase if the heat transfer is to the gas, and it tends to decrease if the gas does work on its environment.


## 18-5 The First Law of Thermodynamics (3 of 8)
+ 18.27 Identify that in an adiabatic process with a gas, there is no heat transfer $Q$ with the environment.
+ 18.28 Identify that in a constant-volume process with a gas, there is no work $W$ done by the gas.
+ 18.29 Identify that in a cyclical process with a gas, there is no net change in the internal energy $\Delta E_{\rm int}$.
+ 18.30 Identify that in a free expansion with a gas, the heat transfer $Q$, work done $W$, and change in internal energy $\Delta E_{\rm int}$ are each zero.


## 18-6 Heat Transfer Mechanisms (1 of 14)
Learning Objectives
+ 18.31 For thermal conduction through a layer, apply the
relationship between the energy-transfer rate $P_{\r, cond}$ and the layer’s area $A$, thermal conductivity $k$, thickness $L$, and temperature difference $\Delta T$ (between its two sides).
+ 18.32 For a composite slab (two or more layers) that has reached the steady state in which temperatures are no longer changing, identify that (by the conservation of energy) the rates of thermal conduction Pcond through the layers must be equal.

+ 18.33 For thermal conduction through a layer, apply the relationship between thermal resistance $R$, thickness $L$, and thermal conductivity $k$.
+ 18.34 Identify that thermal energy can be transferred by convection, in which a warmer fluid (gas or liquid) tends to rise in a cooler fluid.
+ 18.35 In the emission of thermal radiation by an object, apply the relationship between the energy-transfer rate $P_{\rm rad} and the object’s surface area $A$, emissivity $\varepsilon$, and surface temperature $T$ (in kelvins).
