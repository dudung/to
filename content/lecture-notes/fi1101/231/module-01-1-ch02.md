## A Message from Prof. Michio Kaku

{{< youtube weVBAQhl804 >}}

> We physicists flunk students taking elementary physics. And more or less encouraged to do so by engineering department.

> We don't want to train engineer who makes bridges that fall down. Engineers that create skyscrapers that fall over.

> And you encounter freshment physics for the first time, watch out. If you have a rough time, that's the way it is.

> Kaku was inspired to pursue a career in physics after seeing a photograph of Albert Einstein's desk at the time of his death.

> Kaku was fascinated to learn that Einstein had been unable to complete his unified field theory and resolved to dedicate his life to solving this theory.

> By the time Kaku was in high school, he had developed a strong passion for physics, then for a science fair, Michio built a 2.3 MeV “atom smasher” in his parents' garage.

## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.01 Identify that if all parts of an object move in the same direction at the same
rate, we can treat it as a (point-like) particle.
+ 2.02 Identify that the position of a particle is its location on a scaled axis.
+ 2.03 Apply the relationship between a particle's displacement and its initial and
final positions.
+ 2.04 Apply the relationship between a particle's average velocity, its
displacement, and the time interval.
+ 2.05 Apply the relationship between a particle's average speed, the total distance
it moves, and the time interval.
+ 2.06 Given a graph of a particle's position versus time, determine the average
velocity between two times.


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (2 of 9)
+ Kinematics is the classification and comparison of motions
+ For this chapter, we restrict motion in three ways:
  1. We consider motion along a straight line only
  2. We discuss only the motion itself, not the forces that cause it
  3. We consider the moving object to be a particle
+ A particle is either:
  - A point-like object (such as an electron)
  - Or an object that moves such that each part travels in the same
direction at the same rate (no rotation or stretching)


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (3 of 9)
+ Position is measured relative to a reference point:
  - The origin, or zero point, of an axis
+ Position has a sign:
  - Positive direction is in the direction of increasing numbers
  - Negative direction is opposite the positive

Figure 2-1


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (4 of 9)
+ A change in position is called displacement
  - $\Delta x$ is the change in $x$, (final position) − (initial position)
$$\tag{2-1}
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1
$$
+ Examples A particle moves . . .
  - From x = 5 m to x = 12 m: $\Delta x = 7$ m (positive direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 1 m:  $\Delta x = -4$ m (negative direction)
  - From x = 5 m to x = 200 m to x = 5 m: $\Delta x = 0$ m.
+ The actual distance covered is irrelevant


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (5 of 9)
+ Displacement is therefore a vector quantity
  - Direction: along a single axis, given by sign (+ or −)
  - Magnitude: length or distance, in this case meters or feet
+ Ignoring sign, we get its magnitude (absolute value)
  - The magnitude of $\Delta x = -4$ m is 4 m.
+ Checkpoint 1 \
  Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis. Which pairs give a negative displacement: \
  (a) −3 m, +5 m; (b) −3 m, −7 m; (c) 7 m, −3 m?
+ Answer: pairs (b) and (c) \
(b) −7 m − (−3) m = −4 m \
(c) −3 m − 7 m = −10 m


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (6 of 9)
+ Average velocity is the ratio of:
  - A displacement, Δx
  - To the time interval in which the displacement occurred, Δt
$$\tag{2-2}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac{Δx}{Δt} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$
+ Average velocity has units of $\displaystyle \frac{(\rm distance)}{(\rm time)}$
  - Meters per second, m/s
  
  
## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (7 of 9)
+ On a graph of x vs. t, the average velocity is the slope of the
straight line that connects two points
+ Average velocity is therefore a vector quantity
  - Positive slope means positive average velocity
  - Negative slope means negative average velocity

> Terdapat kurva s-landai melewati (1, -5) sebagai awal interval dan (4, 2) sebagai akhir interval.

Figure 2-4

+ This is a graph of position $x$ versus time $t$.
+ To find average velocity, first draw a straight line, start to end, and then find the slope of the line.
  - This vertical distance is how far it moved, start to end: $\Delta x$ = 2 m - (-4 m) = 6 m
  - This horizontal distance is how long it took, start to end: $\Delta t$ = 4 s - 1 s = 3 s
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
v_{\rm avg} & = & {\rm slope \ of \ this \ line} \newline
& = & \displaystyle \frac{\rm rise}{\rm run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
\end{array}
$$


## 2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity (9 of 9)
+ Average speed is the ratio of:
  - The total distance covered
  - To the time interval in which the distance was covered, ∆t
$$\tag{2-3}
s_{\rm avg} = \frac{\rm total \ distance}{Δt}
$$
+ Average speed is always positive (no direction) \
Example A particle moves from x = 3 m to x = −3 m in 2 seconds.
  - Average velocity = −3 m/s; average speed = 3 m/s


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.07 Given a particle's position as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous velocity for any particular time.
+ 2.08 Given a graph of a particle's position versus time, determine
the instantaneous velocity for any particular time.
+ 2.09 Identify speed as the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (2 of 7)
+ Average measurement assume that the velocity is always the
same for the given time interval.

## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (3 of 7)
+ To obtained a better measurement, take smaller time interval
> Seperti grafik sebelumnya dengan tambahan $t_3$, $t_1 < t_3 < t_2$.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (4 of 7)
+ To obtained a better measurement, take smaller time interval.
> Seperti grafik sebelumnya dengan tanpa $t_3$ dan garis lurus menjadi garis singgung di titik $t_2$.


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (5 of 7)
+ Instantaneous velocity, or just velocity, $v$, is:
  - At a single moment in time
  - Obtained from average velocity by shrinking $\Delta t$
  - The slope of the position-time curve for a particle at an instant (the derivative of position)
  - A vector quantity with units $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (distance)}{\rm (time)}$
    * The sign of the velocity represents its direction
$$\tag{2-4}
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (6 of 7)
+ Speed is the magnitude of (instantaneous) velocity

Example A velocity of 5 m/s and −5 m/s both have an associated speed of 5 m/s. \
Checkpoint 2 \
The following equations give the position $x(t)$ of a particle in four situations
(in each equation, $x$ is in meters, $t$ is in seconds, and $t > 0$): (1) $x = 3t - 2$; (2) $x = -4t^2 - 2$; (3) $\displaystyle x = \frac{2}{t^2}$; and (4) $x = -2$. (a) In which situation is the velocity $v$ of the particle constant? (b) In which is $v$ in the negative x direction? \
Answers: \
(a) Situations 1 and 4 (zero) \
(b) Situations 2 and 3


## 2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed (7 of 7)
Example
+ The graph shows the position and velocity of an elevator cab over time.
+ The slope of $x(t)$, and so also the velocity $v$, is zero from 0 to 1 s, and from 9 s on.
+ During the interval bc, the slope is constant and nonzero, so the cab moves with constant velocity (4 m/s).

## 2-3 Acceleration (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.10 Apply the relationship between a particle's average
acceleration, its change in velocity, and the time interval for
that change.
+ 2.11 Given a particle's velocity as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous acceleration for any particular time.
+ 2.12 Given a graph of a particle's velocity versus time, determine
the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time and the
average acceleration between any two particular times.


## 2-3 Acceleration (2 of 7)
+ A change in a particle's velocity is acceleration
+ Average acceleration over a time interval
$$\tag{2-7}
a_{\rm avg} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
+ Instantaneous acceleration (or just acceleration), $a$, for a
single moment in time is:
  - Slope of velocity vs. time graph
$$\tag{2-8}
a = \frac{dv}{dt}
$$


## 2-3 Acceleration (3 of 7)
+ Combining Equations (2-8) and (2-4):
$$\tag{2-9}
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
$$
+ Acceleration is a vector quantity:
  + Positive sign means in the positive coordinate direction
  + Negative sign means the opposite
  + Units of $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (distance)}{\rm (time \ squared)}$


## 2-3 Acceleration (4 of 7)
If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle
are the same, the speed of the particle increases. If the
signs are opposite, the speed decreases.


## 2-3 Acceleration (5 of 7)
Example If a car with velocity $v$ = −25 m/s is braked to a stop in 5.0 s, then  $a$ = +5.0 m/s . Acceleration is positive, but speed has decreased.
+ Note: accelerations can be expressed in units of g
$$\tag{2-10}
1g = 9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2} \ (g \ {\rm unit})
$$


## 2-3 Acceleration (6 of 7)
Checkpoint 3 \
A wombat moves along an $x$ axis. What is the sign of its acceleration if it is moving (a) in the positive direction with increasing speed, (b) in the positive direction with decreasing speed, (c) in the negative direction with increasing speed, and (d) in the negative direction with decreasing speed?

Answers: \
(a) + \
(b) − \
(c) − \
(d) +


## 2-3 Acceleration (7 of 7)
Example
+ The graph shows the velocity and acceleration of an elevator cab over
time.
+ When acceleration is 0 (e.g. interval bc) velocity is constant.
+ When acceleration is positive (ab) upward velocity increases.
+ When acceleration is negative (cd) upward velocity decreases.
+ Steeper slope of the velocity-time graph indicates a larger magnitude of
acceleration: the cab stops in half the time it takes to get up to speed.

## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.13 For constant acceleration, apply the relationships between
position, velocity, acceleration, and elapsed time (Table 2-1).
+ 2.14 Calculate a particle's change in velocity by integrating its
acceleration function with respect to time.
+ 2.15 Calculate a particle's change in position by integrating its
velocity function with respect to time.


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (2 of 8)
+ In many cases acceleration is constant, or nearly so.
+ For these cases, 5 special equations can be used.
+ Note that constant acceleration means a velocity with a constant slope, and a
position with varying slope (unless $a = 0$).

Figure 2-9


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (3 of 8)
+ First basic equation
  - When the acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal
  - Rewrite Eq. (2-7) and rearrange
$$\tag{2-11}
a = a_{\rm avg} = \frac{v - v_0}{t - 0}, \ \ \ \ v = v_0 + at
$$
+ This equation reduces to $v = v_0$ for t = 0
+ Its derivative yields the definition of $a$, $\displaystyle \frac{dv}{dt}$


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (4 of 8)
+ Second basic equation
  - Rewrite Equation (2-2) and rearrange
$$\tag{2-12}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac{x - x_0}{t- 0}, \ \ \ \ x = x_0 + v_{\rm avg} t
$$
+ Average = $\displaystyle \frac{\rm (initial) + (final) }{2}$
$$\tag{2-13}
v_{\rm avg} = \frac12(v_0 + v)
$$
+ Substitute (2-11) to (2-13)


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (5 of 8)
$$\tag{2-14}
v_{\rm avg} = v_0 + \frac12 at
$$
+ Substitute (2-14) into (2-12)
$$\tag{2-15}
x - x_0 = v_0 t + \frac12 at^2
$$


## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (6 of 8)
+ These two equations can be obtained by integrating a constant
acceleration
+ Enough to solve any constant acceleration problem
  - Solve as simultaneous equations
+ Additional useful forms:
$$\tag{2-16}
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)
$$

$$\tag{2-17}
x - x_0 = \frac12 (v_0 + v) t
$$

$$\tag{2-18}
x - x_0 = vt - \frac12 at^2
$$

them.

## 2-4 Constant Acceleration (8 of 8)
Checkpoint 4 \
The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four
situations: (1) $x = 3t - 4$; (2) $x = -5t^3 + 4t^2 + 6$; (3) $\displaystyle x = \frac{2}{t^2} - \frac{4}{t}$; (4) $x = 5t^2 - 3$.

To which of these situations do the equations of Table 2-1 apply?

Answer: \
Situations 1 ($a = 0$) and 4 ($a = ?$).


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (1 of 11)
Learning Objectives
+ 2.16 Identify that if a particle is in free flight (whether upward or
downward) and if we can neglect the effects of air on its motion, the particle has a constant downward acceleration with a magnitude $g$ that we take to be $9.8 \  {\rm m/s^2}$.
+ 2.17 Apply the constant acceleration equations (Table 2-1) to free-fall
motion.

{{< youtube E43-CfukEgs >}}


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (3 of 11)
+ Free-fall acceleration is the rate at which an object accelerates downward in the absence of air resistance
  + Varies with latitude and elevation
  + Written as $g$, standard value of $9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2}$
  + Independent of the properties of the object (mass, density, shape, see Figure 2-12)
+ The equations of motion in Table 2-1 apply to objects in free-fall near Earth's surface
  - In vertical flight (along the $y$ axis)
  - Where air resistance can be neglected


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (4 of 11)
+ The free-fall acceleration is downward (−y direction)
  o Value −g in the constant acceleration equations
+ The free-fall acceleration near Earth's surface is $a = -g = −9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2}$, and the magnitude of the acceleration is $g = 9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2}$.
+ Do not substitute $−9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2}$ for $g$.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (5 of 11)
Checkpoint 5 \
(a) If you toss a ball straight up, what is the sign of the ball's
displacement for the ascent, from the release point to the highest
point? (b) What is it for the descent, from the highest point back to
the release point? (c) What is the ball's acceleration at its highest
point?

Answers: \
(a) The sign is positive (the ball moves upward); \
(b) The sign is negative (the ball moves downward); \
(c) The ball's acceleration is always $9.8 \ {\rm m/s^2}$ at all points along its trajectory.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (6 of 11)
Example \
Alice and Bill are standing at the top of a cliff of height $H$. Both
throw a ball with initial speed $v_0$, Alice straight down and Bill
straight up. The speed of the balls when they hit the ground are $v_A$
and $v_B$ respectively. Which of the following is true: \
(a) $v_A < v_B$; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) $v_A = v_B$; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) $v_A > v_B$.

> Gambar Alice panah ke bawah $v_0$ dan dilanjutkan sampai ke lantai $v_A$; Bill panah ke atas $v_0$ membentuk parabola sampai maksimum lalu ke bawah dan mencapai lantai $v_B$; tinggi Alice dan Bill adalah $H$.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (7 of 11)
Example \
Since the motion up and back down is symmetric, intuition should
tell you that $v = v_0$ \
We can prove that your intuition is correct:

$$
v^2 - v_0 = 2 (-g)
$$

> Gambar Bill melempar ke atas dari posisi awal ($y = H$) dengan laju $v_0$ dan bola kembali ke ketinggian semula ($y = H$) dengan laju $v = v_0$.

This looks just like Bill threw the ball down with speed $v_0$, so the speed at the bottom should be the same as Alice’s ball.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (8 of 11)
Example \
We can also just use the equation directly:
+ Alice: $v_A^2 - v_0^2 = 2(-g)(H - 0)$
+ Bill:  $v_B^2 - v_0^2 = 2(-g)(H - 0)$

They are the same!!


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (9 of 11)
Example\
The pilot of a hovering helicopter drops a lead brick from a height of $1000 \ {\rm m}$. How long does it take to reach the ground and how fast is it moving when it gets there? (neglect air resistance)

> Gambar helikopter pada ketinggian 1000 m menjatuhkan benda, arah sumbu $y$ positif ke atas, $y = 0$ terletak di tanah.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (10 of 11)
Example
+ First choose coordinate system.
+ Origin and $y$-direction.
+ Next write down position equation:
$$
y = y_0 + v_{0y} - \tfrac12 gt^2
$$
+ Realize that $v_{0y} = 0$.
$$
y = y_0 + - \tfrac12 gt^2
$$

> Gambar helikopter pada ketinggian 1000 m menjatuhkan benda, arah sumbu $y$ positif ke atas, $y = 0$ terletak di tanah.


## 2-5 Free-Fall Acceleration (11 of 11)
Example \
Solve for time $t$ when $y = 0$ given that $y_0 = 1000 \ {\rm m}$.

$$
y = y_0 - \tfrac12 gt^2 \rightarrow t = \sqrt{\frac{2y_0}{g}},
$$

which gives $\sqrt{2 \times 1000 / 9.9} = 14.3 \ {\rm s}$.

Recall: $v_y^2 - v_{0y^2} = 2a(y - y_0)$

Solve for $v_y$:
$$
v_y = \pm \sqrt{2gy_0} = - 140 \ {\rm m/s}
$$

## 2-6 Graphical Integration in Motion Analysis (3 of 7)
+ Integrating velocity:
  - Given a graph of an object's velocity $v$ versus time $t$, we can integrate to find position
+ The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives:

+ Integrating acceleration:
  - Given a graph of an object's acceleration $a$ versus time $t$, we can integrate to find velocity
+ The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives:
$$\tag{2-27}
v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a dt
$$
+ The definite integral in the right can be evaluated from a graph:
$$\tag{2-28}
\int_{t_0}^{t_1} a dt = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
{\rm area \ between \ velocity \ curve} \newline
{\rm and \ time \ axis, \ from} \ t_0 \ {\rm to} \ t_1
\end{array}
\right)

Example \
The graph shows the acceleration of a person's head and torso in a whiplash incident.

> Grafik (a) $a ({\rm m/s^2}) - t ({\rm ms})$, sumbu tegak (0, 50, 100), sumbu mendatar (0, 40, 80, 120, 160), kurva Torso: black (0, 0), (40, 0), (100, 50), (120, 50), (160, 20), (170, 20), kurva head: black (110, 0), (160, 90), (170, 50).  

To calculate the torso speed at $t = 0.110 \ {\rm s}$ (assuming an initial speed of $0$), find the area under the pink curve:

> Grafk (b) $a - t$, sumbu tegak (50), sumbu mendatar (40, 100, 110), kurva torso: pink (0, 0), (40, 0), (100, 50), (110, 50), region A, B, C, dashed line (0, 50) - (100, 50) - (100, 0).

+ Area $A = 0$
+ Area $B = 0.5 (0.060 \ {\rm s}) (50 \ {\rm m/s^2}) = 1.5 \ {\rm m/s}$
+ Area $C = (0.010 \ {\rm s}) (50 \ {\rm m/s^2} = 0.5 \ {\rm m/s}$
+ Total area = $2.0 \ {\rm m/s}$.
