## 9-6 Momentum and Kinetic Energy in Collisions (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.28 Distinguish between elastic collisions, inelastic collisions, and
completely inelastic collisions.
+ 9.29 Identify a one-dimensional collision as one where the objects
move along a single axis, both before and after the collision.
+ 9.30 Apply the conservation of momentum for an isolated onedimensional collision to relate the initial momenta of the
objects to their momenta after the collision.
+ 9.31 Identify that in an isolated system, the momentum and
velocity of the center of mass are not changed even if the
objects collide.


## 9-7 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.32 For isolated elastic collisions in one dimension,
apply the conservation laws for both the total energy
and the net momentum of the colliding bodies to
relate the initial values to the values after the
collision.
+ 9.33 For a projectile hitting a stationary target, identify
the resulting motion for the three general cases:
equal masses, target more massive than projectile,
projectile more massive than target.


## 9-8 Collisions in Two Dimensions (1 of 4)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.34 For an isolated system in which a two-dimensional collision occurs,
apply the conservation of momentum along each axis of a coordinate
system to relate the momentum components along an axis before the
collision to the momentum components along the same axis after the
collision.
+ 9.35 For an isolated system in which a two-dimensional elastic collision
occurs, (a) apply the conservation of momentum along each axis to
relate the momentum components along an axis before the collision
to the momentum components along the same axis after the collision
and (b) apply the conservation of total kinetic energy to relate the
kinetic energies before and after the collision.


## 9-9 Systems with Varying Mass: A Rocket (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.36 Apply the first rocket equation to relate the rate at which
the rocket loses mass, the speed of the exhaust products
relative to the rocket, the mass of the rocket, and the
acceleration of the rocket.
+ 9.37 Apply the second rocket equation to relate the change in
the rocket's speed to the relative speed of the exhaust
products and the initial and final mass of the rocket.
+ 9.38 For a moving system undergoing a change in mass at a
given rate, relate that rate to the change in momentum.
