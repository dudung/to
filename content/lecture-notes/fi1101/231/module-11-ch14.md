## 14-1 Fluid Density and Pressure (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 14.01 Distinguish fluids from solids.
+ 14.02 When mass is uniformly distributed, relate density
to mass and volume.
+ 14.03 Apply the relationship between hydrostatic
pressure, force, and the surface area over which
that force acts.


## 14-2 Fluids at Rest (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 14.04 Apply the relationship between the hydrostatic
pressure, fluid density, and the height above or
below a reference level.
+ 14.05 Distinguish between total pressure (absolute
pressure) and gauge pressure.


## 14-3 Measuring Pressure (1 of 5)
Learning Objectives
+ 14.06 Describe how a barometer can measure
atmospheric pressure.
+ 14.07 Describe how an open-tube manometer can
measure the gauge pressure of a gas.


## 14-4 Pascal's Principle (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 14.08 Identify Pascal's principle.
+ 14.09 For a hydraulic lift, apply the relationship between
the input area and displacement and the output area
and displacement.


## 14-5 Archimedes' Principle (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 14.10 Describe Archimedes' principle.
+ 14.11 Apply the relationship between the buoyant force on a body
and the mass of the fluid displaced by the body.
+ 14.12 For a floating body, relate the buoyant force to the
gravitational force.
+ 14.13 For a floating body, relate the gravitational force to the mass
of the fluid displaced by the body.
+ 14.14 Distinguish between apparent weight and actual weight.
+ 14.15 Calculate the apparent weight of a body that is fully or
partially submerged.


## 14-6 The Equation of Continuity (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives

+ 14.18 Apply the equation of continuity to relate the crosssectional area and flow speed at one point in a tube
to those quantities at a different point.
+ 14.19 Identify and calculate volume flow rate.
+ 14.20 Identify and calculate mass flow rate.
