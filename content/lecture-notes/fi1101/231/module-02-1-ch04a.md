## 4-1 Position and Displacement (1 of 4)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.01 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional position vectors for a particle, indicating the components along the axes of a coordinate system.
+ 4.02 On a coordinate system, determine the direction and magnitude of a particle's position vector from its components, and vice versa.
+ 4.03 Apply the relationship between a particle’s displacement vector and its initial and final position vectors.


## 4-2 Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity (1 of 10)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.04 Identify that velocity is a vector quantity and thus has both magnitude and direction and also has components.
+ 4.05 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional velocity vectors for a particle, indicating the components along the axes of the coordinate system.
+ 4.06 In magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations, relate a particle’s initial and final position vectors, the time interval between those positions, and the particle’s average velocity vector.
+ 4.07 Given a particle’s position vector as a function of time, determine its (instantaneous) velocity vector.


## 4-3 Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration (1 to 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.08 Identify that acceleration is a vector quantity, and thus has both magnitude and direction.
+ 4.09 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional acceleration vectors for a particle, indicating the components.
+ 4.10 Given the initial and final velocity vectors of a particle and the time interval, determine the average acceleration vector.
+ 4.11 Given a particle's velocity vector as a function of time, determine its (instantaneous) acceleration vector.
+ 4.12 For each dimension of motion, apply the constant-acceleration equations (Chapter 2) to relate acceleration, velocity, position, and time.


## 4-4 Projectile Motion (1 of 15)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.13 On a sketch of the path taken in projectile motion, explain the magnitudes and directions of the velocity and acceleration components during the flight.
+ 4.14 Given the launch velocity in either magnitude-angle or unit-vector notation, calculate the particle's position, displacement, and velocity at a given instant during the flight.
+ 4.15 Given data for an instant during the flight, calculate the launch velocity.
