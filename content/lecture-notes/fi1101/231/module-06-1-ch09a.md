## 9-1 Center of Mass (1 of 14)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.01 Given the positions of several particles along an axis or a
plane, determine the location of their center of mass.
+ 9.02 Locate the center of mass of an extended, symmetric
object by using the symmetry.
+ 9.03 For a two-dimensional or three-dimensional extended
object with a uniform distribution of mass, determine the
center of mass by (a) mentally dividing the object into
simple geometric figures, each of which can be replaced
by a particle at its center and (b) finding the center of
mass of those particles.


## 9-2 Newton's Second Law for a System of Particles (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.04 Apply Newton's second law to a system of particles by
relating the net force (of the forces acting on the
particles) to the acceleration of the system’s center of
mass.
+ 9.05 Apply the constant-acceleration equations to the motion
of the individual particles in a system and to the motion
of the system’s center of mass.
+ 9.06 Given the mass and velocity of the particles in a system,
calculate the velocity of the system’s center of mass.


## 9-2 Newton's Second Law for a System of Particles (2 of 6)
+ 9.07 Given the mass and acceleration of the particles in a
system, calculate the acceleration of the system’s
center of mass.
+ 9.08 Given the position of a system’s center of mass as a
function of time, determine the velocity of the center
of mass.
+ 9.09 Given the velocity of a system’s center of mass as a
function of time, determine the acceleration of the
center of mass.


## 9-2 Newton's Second Law for a System of Particles (3 of 6)
+ 9.10 Calculate the change in the velocity of a com by
integrating the com’s acceleration function with
respect to time.
+ 9.11 Calculate a com’s displacement by integrating the
com’s velocity function with respect to time.
+ 9.12 When the particles in a two-particle system move
without the system’s com moving, relate the
displacements of the particles and the velocities of
the particles.


## 9-3 Linear Momentum (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.13 Identify that momentum is a vector quantity and thus
has both magnitude and direction and also
components.
+ 9.14 Calculate the (linear) momentum of a particle as the
product of the particle's mass and velocity.
+ 9.15 Calculate the change in momentum (magnitude and
direction) when a particle changes its speed and
direction of travel.


## 9-3 Linear Momentum (2 of 6)
+ 9.16 Apply the relationship between a particle's
momentum and the (net) force acting on the particle.
+ 9.17 Calculate the momentum of a system of particles as
the product of the system's total mass and its centerof-mass velocity.
+ 9.18 Apply the relationship between a system's center-ofmass momentum and the net force acting on the
system.


## 9-4 Collision and Impulse (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.19 Identify that impulse is a vector quantity and thus
has both magnitude and direction and components.
+ 9.20 Apply the relationship between impulse and
momentum change.
+ 9.21 Apply the relationship between impulse, average
force, and the time interval taken by the impulse.
+ 9.22 Apply the constant-acceleration equations to relate
impulse to force.


## 9-4 Collision and Impulse (2 of 12)
+ 9.23 Given force as a function of time, calculate the
impulse (and thus also the momentum change) by
integrating the function.
+ 9.24 Given a graph of force versus time, calculate the
impulse (and thus also the momentum change) by
graphical integration.
+ 9.25 In a continuous series of collisions by projectiles,
calculate average force on the target by relating it to
the mass collision rate and the velocity change of
each projectile.


## 9-5 Conservation of Linear Momentum (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 9.26 For an isolated system of particles, apply the
conservation of linear momenta to relate the initial
momenta of the particles to their momenta at a later
instant.
+ 9.27 Identify that the conservation of linear momentum
can be done along an individual axis by using
components along that axis, provided there is no net
external force component along that axis.

+ Linear Momentum & Newton's 2nd Law
+ Collision and Impulse
+ Conservation of Linear Momentum
