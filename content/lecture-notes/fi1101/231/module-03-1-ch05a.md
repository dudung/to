## 5-1 Newton's First and Second Laws (1 of 20)
Learning Objectives
+ 5.01 Identify that a force is a vector quantity and thus has both magnitude and direction and also components.
+  5.02 Given two or more forces acting on the same particle, add the forces as vectors to get the net force.
+ 5.03 Identify Newton's first and second laws of motion.
+ 5.04 Identify inertial reference frames.


## 5-1 Newton's First and Second Laws (2 of 20)
+  5.05 Sketch a free-body diagram for an object, showing the object as a particle and drawing the forces acting on it as vectors anchored to the particle.
+ 5.06 Apply the relationship between net force on an object, its mass, and the produced acceleration.
+ 5.07 Identify that only external forces on an object can cause the object to accelerate.


## 5-2 Some Particular Forces (1 of 15)
Learning Objectives
+ 5.08 Determine the magnitude and direction of gravitational force on a mass, for a given free-fall acceleration.
+ 5.09 Identify that weight is the magnitude of the net force required to prevent a body from falling freely, measured by the frame of ground.
+ 5.10 Identify that a scale gives an object’s weight when the measurement is done in an inertial frame but not in an accelerating frame, where it gives an apparent weight.


## 5-2 Some Particular Forces (2 of 15)
+ 5.11 Determine the magnitude and direction of the normal force on an object when the object is pressed or pulled onto a surface.
+ 5.12 Identify that the force parallel to the surface is a frictional force that appears when the object slides or attempts to slide.
+ 5.13 Identify that a tension force is said to pull at both ends of a cord (or a cord-like object) when the cord is taut.


## 5 Summary (1 of 4)
+ Newtonian Mechanics
  - Forces are pushes or pulls
  - Forces cause acceleration
+ Force
  - Vector quantities
  - 1 N =  1 kg m/s2
  - Net force is the sum of all forces on a body


## 5 Summary (2 of 4)
+ Newton's First Law
  - If there is no net force on a body, the body remains at rest if it is initially at rest, or moves in a straight line at constant speed if it is in motion.
+ Inertial Reference Frames
  - Frames in which Newtonian mechanics holds

## 5 Summary (3 of 4)
+ Mass
  - The characteristic that relates the body's acceleration to the net force
  - Scalar quantity
+ Newton's Second Law
  $$\tag{5-1}
  \vec{F}_{\rm net} = m \vec{a}
  $$
  - Free-body diagram represents the forces on one object


## 5 Summary (4 of 4)
+ Some Particular Forces
  - Weight:
  $$\tag{5-12}
  W =  mg
  $$
  - Normal force from a surface
  - Friction along a surface
  - Tension in a cord
