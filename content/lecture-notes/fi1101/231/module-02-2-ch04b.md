## 4-5 Uniform Circular Motion (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.16 Sketch the path taken in uniform circular motion and explain the velocity and acceleration vectors (magnitude and direction) during the motion.
+ 4.17 Apply the relationships between the radius of the circular path, the period, the particle's speed, and the particle’s acceleration magnitude


## 4-6 Relative Motion in One Dimension (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.18 Apply the relationship between a particle's position, velocity, and acceleration as measured from two reference frames that move relative to each other at a constant velocity and along a single axis.


## 4-7 Relative Motion in Two Dimensions (1 of 10)
Learning Objectives
+ 4.19 Apply the relationship between a particle's position, velocity, and acceleration as measured from two reference frames that move relative to each other at a constant velocity and in two dimensions.


## 4 Summary (5 of 6)
+ Uniform Circular Motion
+ Relative motion
