The course is 4 (1) credit hours, 4 for lecture and 1 for laboratory activities, and given at the first semester for most of all bachelor programs of an institute of technology ([Fisika, 2021](https://fi.itb.ac.id/kurikulum-dan-silabus-program-studi-sarjana-fisika/#:~:text=FI1101)). And as the main reference it uses the textbook Principle of Physics, 10th Edition International Student Version with about 1320 pages ([Halliday et al., 2014](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Principles+of+Physics%2C+10th+Edition+International+Student+Version-p-9781118413784)). A draft of week plan is available ([Mahardika et al., 2023](https://osf.io/guj9s)) and there are also some slides for personal use from a physics professor ([Iskandar, 2022](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rT60qzkEOIakWDF1tT1ay_FVw-FhruAP)). Then, even that you are working with a 15-week semester, there is another approach by designing a 12-week plan ([Talbert, 2022](https://rtalbert.org/the-12-week-plan-for-building-courses/)).

## evaluations
There are some evaluations for this course, which are mid and final exams + remedial one, some quizzes and assignments, set of laboratory practice, and a research based learning project performed of group of students, where each evaluation components has its certain weight ([Mahardika & Akbar, 2023](https://osf.io/km8gn)). The final score before it is mapped to A, AB, .., E, would have sort of following form

$$
S = w_1 E_1 + w_2 E_2 + w_3 E_3 + w_q Q + w_l L + w_r R
$$

where E₁ — E₃ are for exams, Q is for average of quizzes and assignment, L is for average of laborarory practice, and R is for the research based learning project. And the weights are normalized

$$
w_a + w_b + w_q + w_l + w_r = 1,
$$

with a, b might be 1, 3, or 2, 3, the best two of three if a student has to take the remedial but when not they are simply 1, 2.

And for numeric values (0–100) to letters conversion (A, AB, B, BC, C, D, E), the boundaries might be 75, 68, 60, 55, 50, and 45, e.g. 54.5 would be mapped to C.
