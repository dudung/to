## web scraping vs web crawling
+ Web scraping is about extracting data from one or more websites, while crawling is about finding or discovering URLs or links on the web ([Zyte, 2021](https://www.zyte.com/learn/difference-between-web-scraping-and-web-crawling/)).
+  Web scraping aims to extract the data on web pages, and web crawling purposes to index and find web pages ([Baeldung, 2023](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/web-crawling-vs-web-scraping)).
+ Crawling would be essentially what Google, Yahoo, MSN, etc. do, looking for ANY information, while scraping is generally targeted at certain websites, for specfic data, e.g. for price comparison, so are coded quite differently ([Ben & Man, 2013](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4327523/9475509)).
+ In short, web crawling involves discovering URLs or links, while web scraping is extracting data from a website ([ZenRows, 2023](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-crawling-vs-web-scraping)).
