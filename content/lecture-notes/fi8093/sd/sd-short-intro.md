## introduction
+ System dinamics, which abbreviated as SD, is a methodology based on feedback systems borrowed from control theory, and it can handle easily the non-linearity and time-delay and the multi-loop structures of the complex and dynamic systems ([Kala et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-2045-2)).
+ It is a method that extends beyond conventional domain of systems approach to large-scale complex engineering problems, since it deals with interaction of various elements of a system in time and captures the dynamic aspect by incorporating concepts such stock, flows, feedback, and delays, and thereby provides an insight into the dynamic behavior of system over time ([Tang & Vijay, 2001](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/wine/dosdevices/z:/afs/athena/course/other/esd.83/www/notebook/System%20Dynamics%20final.doc)).
+ In its full development, SD is a discipline with the scope of science, education, law, engineering, or medicine ([Forrester, 2009](https://classes.cc.gatech.edu/AY2018/cs4803cc_spring/research_papers/Forrester-SystemDynamics.pdf))
