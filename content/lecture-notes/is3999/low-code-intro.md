## introduction
+ Low code technology uses drag-and-drop tools, which is both user-friendly and responsive, rather than several lines of complex code and language structure to facilitate the development and delivery of applications already with user interfaces, combinations, and informations ([Oracle, 2022](https://developer.oracle.com/learn/technical-articles/what-is-lowcode)).
+ It simplifies the creation of software considerably and saves time by utilizing a graphical user interface as well as predefined visual components, where software development can generally be performed up to 80 percent without writing code ([IONOS, 2023](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-low-code/)).
+ It reduces the coding time and helps to accelerate the growth of bussiness applications, that would lead to lower initial cost of deployment and maintenance ([Duggal, 2022](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/programming-tutorial/no-code-app-builder)).
+ There are great benefits from low code software development, but it is also accompanied by management challanges as well, since broad use of these tools instituionalize the "shadow IT" phenomenon, which has bedeviled IT organization for decades and could make the problem much worse, if it is not governed properly, e.g. citizen developers tend to create application that do not work or scale well, then turn them over IT ([Johannessen & Davenport, 2021](https://hbr.org/2021/06/when-low-code-no-code-development-works-and-when-it-doesnt)).
+ There are some best low-code development platforms suggested and review on the net, from Visual LANSA and Feathery to Retool and Quixy  ([STH, 2023](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/low-code-development-platforms/)).
