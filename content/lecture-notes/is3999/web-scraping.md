## introduction
+ Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website, where the information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the users, e.g. a spreadsheet or an API ([Perez, 2023](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/what-is-web-scraping/)).
+ Web scraping is used to scape data from webpages automatically on large scale, where it is performed to convert data in complex HTML structures to structured format as a spreadsheet or database, which later used for various purposes such as research, analysis, and automation ([Dhanashree, 2023](https://nanonets.com/blog/web-scraping-with-node-js/)).
+ Search engines like Google scrape the web to index sites and provide them as results for users' queries ([Martinez, 2023](https://blog.logrocket.com/best-node-js-web-scrapers-use-case/)).


## legality
+ There is no law or rule banning web scraping, but it does not mean every information on every webs can be scaped ([Urban, 2023](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/)).
+ There is nothing inherently illegal about web scraping, since when a website publishes data, it is usually available to the public, and as a result, free to scrape ([Holcombe, 2023](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-web-scraping/)).
+ Web scraping is actually not illegal on its own but one should be ethical while doing it, since when it is done in a good way it can help us to make the best use of the web, e.g. search engine like Google ([madhur912, 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-scrapping-legal-or-illegal/)).


## illustration
