Some might-related refs for boid application on fish motion.

## ref_1
Simulated bird-like, "bird-oid" objects, or boid, even they are representing other sorf of creatures such as schools of fish rather than flocks of bird, requires three rules, which are collision avoidance, velocity matching, and flock centering ([Reynolds, 1987](https://doi.org/10.1145/37401.37406)).

## ref_2
Boid model, which is commond extended by adding new six behavior rules to the three classical boid rules, shows more realistic aggregate motion of fish schools similar to the behaviors of real fish ([Kawabayashi & Chen, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.209)).
