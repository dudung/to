+ A reference titled "Gold Nanoparticle Monolayers from Sequential Interfacial Ligand Exchange and Migration in a Three-Phase System" informed, will be discussed and studied.

+ Role of heating until 100 &deg;C in activation of HAuCl₄ agglomeration ability, which can explain why the acid does not agglomerate.
+ Relation between citrate addition and Au nanoparticle aggregation inhibition, which might depend on concentration or in molecular scale the ratio of numbers of particle types.
+ Model interactions between agent representing [AuCl₄]⁻, H⁺, citrate, water and its usage in ABM, where all have random motion, e.g. Brownian motion due to temperature agitation.
