+ Three mechanisms: (1) underground river erodes tunnel, (2) excessive water withdrawn reduce soil stress, (3) mineral dissolves in water create empty pores.
+ Preliminary and rough experiments plastic bottle with water inlet and outlet filled with (1) sand only, (2) salt only, (3) layers of sand - salt, (4) layers of sand - mixture of sand and salt.
+ Physical model and simulation using solid disks and salt-pressed disks to build a 2-d granular configuration, using flow of water to dissolve the salt disks.
