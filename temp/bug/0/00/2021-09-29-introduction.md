Some but no complete notes about bug.

+ `24 Feb 2022` Another milestone with 178 posts, all files counted. \
    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/0/00/0000-e-178-posts.png)
+ `10 Jan 2022` Rename and move post related to line charge and surface charge. Not yet come to equilibrium convention for the folders. It only uses numbers and each folder is limited to ten post files.
+ `28 Dec 2021` Fortunately my [SlideShare](https://de.slideshare.net/sparisoma) works again through Facebook. It is now 105 Präsentationen there after about 11 months vacant. Know it while finishing [0171](http://localhost:4000/pages/0171). ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/0/00/0000-d-slideshare-dec2021.png)
+ `14 Dec 2021` Make [bug](https://github.com/dudung/bug) private, and use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the `_site`, which is now [bugx](https://bugx.vercel.app/) as it was renamed into.
+ `12 Dec 2021` Cancel the use of [Jekyll custom permalink](https://github.com/NiklasEi/jekyll_custom_permalink) by Niklas Eicker, since it works locally but not supported on Github. Yesterday was only for knowing it :-(.
+ `06 Dec 2021` Put sound on a post using [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) video by hiding the picture and only showing the control buttons. Appearance in mobile device is still different. Fist try is still in [0222](0222.html).
+ `04 Dec 2021` [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is used as comment box replacing the previous above link. Author should post initial tweet first, then embed it to a bug post. It begins with [0200](0220.html).
+ `19 Nov 2021` Found one possibility of bug acronym as bridging the understanding gap, which is title of the work of David Gelperin available in [RG 311966110](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311966110).
+ `17 Nov 2021` Struggle to find info about [A12 screen size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_A12) (720 × 1600), which is different than shown by [mydevice.io](https://www.mydevice.io/) 384px, (385 &times; 854), (375 &times; 800), 1.875. Try [Mobile simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk/related), a Chrome extension, but it does not show the same thing as browser emulator as guided by [Rusen](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/emulate-mobile-device-desktop-browser/). Try [using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) that `max-width` is different than `max-device-width`, but responsive design does not work. Find solution with `meta` as in [so-24911272](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24911272). Try to allow zoom in remove `user-scalable=0` dan set `maximum-scale=5`. It works. Finalize margins, which take to much spaces.
+ `14 Nov 2021` A milestone with 60 posts, but not all concepts, dev files counted. \
    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/0/00/0000-c-60-posts.png)
+ `25 oct 2021` Move search to [progress](0001.html) and modify [home](/). And find &#x1F41E; in HTML symbol. Keep using &bull; symbol, since can not find any better one. It is microbe &#x1F9A0;, but a cool symbol.
+ <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/0/00/0000-b-frame-of-reference-box.png" style="float:left; padding-right:10px;" />`20 Oct 2021` Someone Geburtstag x0C and inspires new style of the symbol for frame of reference. It is more modern compared to the old fashion way. But it support only the type of $\bigodot$ since it is difficult for the $\bigotimes$ type.
+ <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/0/00/0000-a-bug.gif" style="float:right;" />`02 Oct 2021` Try to create the first animated bug with [FlipaClip](https://flipaclip.us/) and edit it online using [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/). It is 150 px &times; 54 px with 8 bit depth and 41.4 KB in size. By the way, the [GIF Maker](https://ezgif.com/maker) is interesting to try.
+ `29 Sep 2021` After 12 days in repairing store (following a week without and a week with antibiotics) and MDs can not find the bug in me, go home, then I think it would be nice if I create this [bug(6)](https://dudung.github.io/bug) as reminder of our limitation as human. All previous posts are reset and some will be transferred after selection and proper modification.
+ `16 Jun 2021` Try to relate this with [KMS ITB](https://knowledge.itb.ac.id/) (Knowledge Management System ITB). Lost some chronologies $\large\color{#c00}\times$. At campus [update gems](https://github.com/dudung/butir/blob/main/log/2021-06-16.txt) $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$.
+ `23 Apr 2021` Change layout catatan (now refs) $\Leftrightarrow$ butir (now &nbsp;), refs $\Rightarrow$ notes. Copy two items from butiran [0013](https://dudung.github.io/butir/0013) (with reduction) and [0014](https://dudung.github.io/butir/0014) (with minimal modification).
+ `22 Apr 2021` Rename it to [butir(5)](https://dudung.github.io/butir) from previous name on eleven days before today and hope it will remain stable :smiley:. Todo: fix history link for the first three posts $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$.
+ `01 Sya 1442` Modify [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) link $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$, for all authors $\large\color{#c00}\times$.
+ `12 Apr 2021` Create this first post, use [Liquid ](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for showing multiple authors (in cite as and after date) $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$, fix something (force update only works for updated file) $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$, add items for mapping (manually in grid 2&times;2) $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$, fix mapped link with CSS (hidden by h1) $\color{#0c0}\checkmark$.
+ `10 Apr 2021` Create [item(4)](https://dudung.github.io/item) from [code(3)](https://dudung.github.io/code-failed) from [soal(2)](https://dudung.github.io/soal) from [butiran(1)](https://butiran.github.io).
