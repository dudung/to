## 10-1 Rotational Variables (1 of 13)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.01 Identify that if all parts of a body rotate around a fixed
axis locked together, the body is a rigid body.
+ 10.02 Identify that the angular position of a rotating rigid
body is the angle that an internal reference line makes
with a fixed, external reference line.
+ 10.03 Apply the relationship between angular displacement
and the initial and final angular positions.
+ 10.04 Apply the relationship between average angular
velocity, angular displacement, and the time interval for
that displacement.


## 10-1 Rotational Variables (2 of 13)
+ 10.05 Apply the relationship between average angular acceleration,
change in angular velocity, and the time interval for that
change.
+ 10.06 Identify that counterclockwise motion is in the positive
direction and clockwise motion is in the negative direction.
+ 10.07 Given angular position as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous angular velocity at any particular time and the
average angular velocity between any two particular times.
+ 10.08 Given a graph of angular position versus time, determine the
instantaneous angular velocity at a particular time and the
average angular velocity between any two particular times.


## 10-1 Rotational Variables (3 of 13)
+ 10.09 Identify instantaneous angular speed as the magnitude of the
instantaneous angular velocity.
+ 10.10 Given angular velocity as a function of time, calculate the
instantaneous angular acceleration at any particular time and
the average angular acceleration between any two particular
times.
+ 10.11 Given a graph of angular velocity versus time, determine the
instantaneous angular acceleration at any particular time and
the average angular acceleration between any two particular
times.


## 10-1 Rotational Variables (4 of 13)
+ 10.12 Calculate a body’s change in angular velocity by
integrating its angular acceleration function with
respect to time.
+ 10.13 Calculate a body’s change in angular position by
integrating its angular velocity function with
respect to time.


## 10-2 Rotation with Constant Angular Acceleration (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.14 For constant angular acceleration, apply the
relationships between angular position, angular
displacement, angular velocity, angular
acceleration, and elapsed time (Table 10-1).


## 10-3 Relating the Linear and Angular Variables (1 of 13)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.15 For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, relate the
angular variables of the body (angular position, angular
velocity, and angular acceleration) and the linear
variables of a particle on the body (position, velocity,
and acceleration) at any given radius.
+ 10.16 Distinguish between tangential acceleration and radial
acceleration and draw a vector for each in a sketch of a
particle on a body rotating about an axis, for both an
increase in angular speed and a decrease.


## 10-4 Kinetic Energy of Rotation (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.17 Find the rotational inertia of a particle about a
point.
+ 10.18 Find the total rotational inertia of many particles
moving around the same fixed axis.
+ 10.19 Calculate the rotational kinetic energy of a body in
terms of its rotational inertia and its angular speed.
