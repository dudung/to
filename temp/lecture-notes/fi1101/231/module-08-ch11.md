## 11-1 Rolling as Translation and Rotation Combined (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.01 Identify that smooth rolling can be considered as a
combination of pure translation and pure rotation
+ 11.02 Apply the relationship between the center-of-mass
speed and the angular speed of a body in smooth rolling


## 11-2 Forces and Kinetic Energy of Rolling (1 of 12)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.03 Calculate the kinetic energy of a body in smooth rolling
as the sum of the translational kinetic energy of the
center of mass and the rotational kinetic energy around
the center of mass.
+ 11.04 Apply the relationship between the work done on a
smoothly rolling object and its kinetic energy change.
+ 11.05 For smooth rolling (and thus no sliding), conserve
mechanical energy to relate initial energy values to the
values at a later point.


## 11-2 Forces and Kinetic Energy of Rolling (2 of 12)
+ 11.06 Draw a free-body diagram of an accelerating body that
is smoothly rolling on a horizontal surface or up or
down on a ramp.
+ 11.07 Apply the relationship between the center-of-mass
acceleration and the angular acceleration.
+ 11.08 For smooth rolling up or down a ramp, apply the
relationship between the object’s acceleration, its
rotational inertia, and the angle of the ramp.


## 11-3 The Yo-Yo (1 of 3)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.09 Draw a free-body diagram of a yo-yo moving up or
down its string.
+ 11.10 Identify that a yo-yo is effectively an object that rolls
smoothly up or down a ramp with an incline angle of
90°.
+ 11.11 For a yo-yo moving up or down its string, apply the
relationship between the yo-yo's acceleration and its
rotational inertia.
+ 11.12 Determine the tension in a yo-yo's string as the yo-yo
moves up or down the string.


## 11-4 Torque Revisited (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.13 Identify that torque is a vector quantity.
+ 11.14 Identify that the point about which a torque is calculated
must always be specified.
+ 11.15 Calculate the torque due to a force on a particle by
taking the cross product of the particle's position vector
and the force vector, in either unit-vector notation or
magnitude-angle notation.
+ 11.16 Use the right-hand rule for cross products to find the
direction of a torque vector.


## 11-5 Angular Momentum (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.17 Identify that angular momentum is a vector quantity.
+ 11.18 Identify that the fixed point about which an angular
momentum is calculated must always be specified.
+ 11.19 Calculate the angular momentum of a particle by taking
the cross product of the particle's position vector and its
momentum vector, in either unit-vector notation or
magnitude-angle notation.
+ 11.20 Use the right-hand rule for cross products to find the
direction of an angular momentum vector.


## 11-6 Newton's Second Law in Angular Form (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.21 Apply Newton's second law in angular form to
relate the torque acting on a particle to the resulting
rate of change of the particle's angular momentum,
all relative to a specified point.


## 11-7 Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.22 For a system of particles, apply Newton's second law in
angular form to relate the net torque acting on the system to
the rate of the resulting change in the system's angular
momentum.
+ 11.23 Apply the relationship between the angular momentum of a
rigid body rotating around a fixed axis and the body's
rotational inertia and angular speed around that axis.
+ 11.24 If two rigid bodies rotate about the same axis, calculate their
total angular momentum.


## 11-8 Conservation of Angular Momentum (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.25 When no external net torque acts on a system along
a specified axis, apply the conservation of angular
momentum to relate the initial angular momentum
value along that axis to the value at a later instant


## 11-9 Precession of a Gyroscope (1 of 7)
Learning Objectives
+ 11.26 Identify that the gravitational force acting on a spinning
gyroscope causes the spin angular momentum vector (and
thus the gyroscope) to rotate about the vertical axis in a
motion called precession.
+ 11.27 Calculate the precession rate of a gyroscope.
+ 11.28 Identify that a gyroscope's precession rate is independent of
the gyroscope's mass.
