Composite adsorbent modeling with machine learning
<!--more-->

+ N/A


## mar
+ `19-tue` `1315` Formula is obtained but not yet the procedure, spatial distance between making the adsorbent and UV-vis measurement, MB target concentration could be also varied, all data will be recorded not only the good one for ML.


## feb
+ `29-thu` `1400` Experiment preparation, variation design, defining parameters.
+ `20-tue` `1400` Topic change, co-supervisor, synthesize in lab, literature. vacation plan.
