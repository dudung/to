## source
At position $\vec{r}_s$ there is source of vibration

$$\tag{1}
\psi_s(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \sin(\omega_i t + \varphi_i)
$$

which is simplified as superposition of $N$ simple harmonic motion of physical quantity $A_i$ with angular frequency $\omega_i$ and initial phase $\varphi_i$, where $A_i$ migth represent difference between variation of air pressure and normal atmospheric pressure

$$\tag{2}
\Delta p = p(t) - p_0
$$

or difference between variation of position of parts of solid body, e.g. the ground, to their equilibrium position

$$\tag{3}
\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}(t) - \vec{r}_0.
$$  

Sound waves are accomodated by Eqn (2), while waves on solid are by Eqn (3). The first are longitudinal waves, while the later could be longitudinal and transversal waves.


## wave
Function represents wave from previous source of vibration

$$\tag{4}
\psi({\vec{r}, t}) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \sin(\omega_i t + \varphi_i - k_i |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_s|),
$$

where wavenumber is

$$\tag{5}
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

with wavelength $\lambda$. If $v$ is wave velocity then it is obtained from

$$\tag{6}
v = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

or

$$\tag{7}
v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \lambda f.
$$


## intensity
Intensity at vibration source is proportional to square of amplitude

$$\tag{8}
I_s \propto  | A |^2
$$

and at distance $r$ from the source

$$\tag{9}
I(r) = \frac{r_o^2}{r^2} I_s
$$

for sound assuming it is spreading as spherical wave, where $r_o$ is size of the source.


## resonance
When wave arrives at some position $\vec{r}_j$ it will induce vibration on that position which can be considered as sinusoidal driving force with amplitude $F_0$ and frequency $\omega$. Equation of motion at that placew would be

$$\tag{10}
m \frac{d^2 \psi}{dt^2} + b \frac{d\psi}{dt} + k \psi = F_0 \cos (\omega t + \varphi_d)
$$

with damping coefficient $b$, spring constant $k$, and mass $m$. Then it can be obtained that

$$\tag{11}
A_j = \frac{F_0/m}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + 4\gamma^2
\omega^2}}
$$

is the amplitude at that position, where

$$\tag{12}
\omega_0 = \sqrt\frac{k}{m}
$$

and

$$\tag{13}
\gamma = \frac{b}{2m}.
$$

Then it should be assumed

$$\tag{14}
F_0 \propto \sqrt{I(r)},
$$

to relate this part with previous one.


## velocity
Sound velocity in liquid is obtained from

$$\tag{15}
v_{\rm liq} = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}},
$$

in solid from

$$\tag{16}
v_{\rm sol} = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}},
$$

and in ideal gas from

$$\tag{16}
v_{\rm gas} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_a R T}{M}}.
$$

Sound velocity in water is about 1500 m/s and in air 331 m/s ([Gea-Banacloche, 2020](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_I_-_Mechanics_Sound_Oscillations_and_Waves_(OpenStax)/17%3A_Sound/17.03%3A_Speed_of_Sound)), while maximum velocity is about 1250-1730 m/s on various sediment, e.g clay-dominated, silt-dominated, sandy, gas-charged, ([Novak et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020560)).


## natural frequency
Earth natural frequencey of Schumann resonance is about 7.83 Hz ([Biotonomy, 2017](https://www.biotonomy.com/post/how-electromagnetic-pollution-in-buildings-effect-our-wellbeing)). For building it depend also on soil base, e.g Limetone 7.1 Hz, breccia and debris deposits 5.3 Hz, alluvional deposits 4.6 Hz, year of built 4.0 - 5.8 Hz, and number of floors, e.g. 2-5 floors gives 7.0 - 3.6 Hz ([Gangone et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10518-023-01644-8)).


## damping ratio
See ([Irvine, 2002](https://cdm.ing.unimo.it/dokuwiki/_media/wikipaom2017/damping_cross-reference_and_material_properties.pdf)) for viscous damping ratio.


## summaries
+ From Eqns (8), (9), and (11)
$$\tag{17}
A(r + \Delta r) = \frac{\omega^2 A(r)}{\sqrt{[\omega_0^2(r) - \omega^2]^2 + 4\gamma^2(r) \omega^2}} \left( \frac{r}{r + \Delta r} \right)
$$
with $A_s = A(r_s)$ at the source and $r_s > 0$, it is not a point source but more to spherical source for simplicity.
